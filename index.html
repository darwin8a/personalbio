  <p class="paragraph1">Hello, my name is Darwin Ochoa, and I am currently a freshman at CSU Chico!</p>
  <p class="paragraph1">I come from a small family of four, and am the oldest. Since the age of 3 I lived in San Jose</p>
  <p class="paragraph1">California. Having a mother who cleaned houses for a living, I would often go to work with her since</p>
  <p class="paragraph1">there wasn't anyone around who could babysit. Now, most of my mom's clients were people who</p>
  <p class="paragraph1">worked for big technology companies like linkedin, Cisco, Yahoo, Apple, Google .. etc. I remember</p>
  <p class="paragraph1">being constantly amazed at these people because they would always have new devices or forms of</p>
  <p class="paragraph1">technology that were fairly rare at the time. Because of this exposure I grew up with a curiousity and</p>
  <p class="paragraph1">passion for technology, and software and the work that went into making these things funciton. Of course,</p>
  <p class="paragraph1">being lucky enough to make it to a 4-year institution, I chose to be a computer-science major with a minor</p>
  <p class="paragraph1">in psychology. I am currently aiming to graduate in the year 2020, and hopefully get right back into school</p>
  <p class="paragraph1">so I can begin the pursuit for my masters. After that, it's wherever the wind takes me. </p>
