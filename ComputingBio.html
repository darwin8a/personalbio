  <p>Like I had mentioned in my introduction page, I grew up around people who worked in the tech industry.</p>
  <p>I was really curious about the new upcoming technology, and seeing how every year they just got</p>
  <p>better and better. I had never really known what working with computers was called, until college.</p>
  <p>So far I have really enjoyed my coding experince with c++, html, and css. I'm actually excited to see</p>
  <p>as to how my skills will grow!</p>
